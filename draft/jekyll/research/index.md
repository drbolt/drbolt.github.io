My primary interest is in the long-range regulatory control and chromatin dynamics that modulate expression of genes during embryonic development. During events such as lineage specification and differentiation, gene expression is highly regulated by the changing cellular context. The genes that facilitate these important biological transitions are frequently characterized by two important properties: these genes are associated with an array of *cis*-acting regulatory elements which precisely control the expression of their target gene and the cell controls the availability of these elements using an assortment of epigenetic modifications. Particular types of mutations, such as chromosome translocations allow for a simple two-part dissection of regulatory elements. These regulatory elements can be dispersed over great genomic distances, and thus are difficult to identify. We utilize chromosome translocations in mice to identify and learn about the function of important developmental regulators and how their expression is controlled.

Specifically, my graduate work is focused on the role of a T-box transcription factor in the development of the urogenital system in mouse. The T-box gene *Tbx18* serves a vital role in the early budding and outgrowth of the prostate during late gestation. Expression of *Tbx18* in the urogenital mesenchyme directs undifferentiated mesenchymal cells to coalesce and differentiate into smooth muscle of the prostate. We have characterized a chromosome translocation mutation that disrupts the *cis*-regulatory structure of the *Tbx18* locus and reduces the expression of *Tbx18* in the developing prostate. In animals with insufficient levels of *TBX18*, the smooth muscle layer forms improperly, and is incapable of instructing the developing prostatic epithelium to proliferate and bud properly. We use a combination of tools ranging from next-generation sequencing to generation of transgenic mice and traditional genetics to study both the regulatory structure of the *Tbx18* locus as well as its function downstream in mediating these processes.
